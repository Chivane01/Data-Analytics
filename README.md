# 🧠 Fintech Funnel Strategy Projects

This repository showcases two complementary data analytics projects, each examining user funnel performance in a fintech product context. While both projects address conversion drop-offs, they use different analytical techniques to model impact and guide optimization strategies.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. Behavioral Analytics for Funnel Drop-Off Recovery in Fintech  
📍 `1_Behavioral_Analytics_for_Funnel_Drop-Off_Recovery_in_Fintech/`

- Simulates a user journey from Sign-Up → KYC → Account Linking → Transaction
- Uses KMeans clustering to segment user behavior across support, delays, and funnel progression
- Identifies user personas (e.g., early drop-offs, late abandoners, high-converters)
- Simulates revenue uplift by recovering high-potential user segments

🔧 **Skills:** Behavioral feature engineering, unsupervised learning, delay metrics, support log integration, revenue modeling

---

### 2. Conversion Lift Modeling for Open Banking Funnels  
📍 `2_Conversion_Lift_Modeling_for_Open_Banking_Funnels/`

- Simulates a realistic 4-stage funnel in an open banking context
- Quantifies drop-off rates and models 10% improvement scenarios at each stage
- Visualizes projected conversion gains and revenue uplift per step
- Prioritizes UX/product interventions based on impact

🔧 **Skills:** Funnel simulation, drop-off math, what-if modeling, visualization, prioritization strategy, data engineering
