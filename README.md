# 🧠 Behavioral Funnel Analytics – Fintech Product Case Study

**Goal:** Identify behavioral drop-offs and simulate revenue recovery in a digital banking funnel.

This Python-based project simulates and analyzes a 4-step user funnel (Sign-Up → KYC → Link → Transaction), merges support logs and transaction data, and segments users using KMeans clustering.

---

## 📌 Business Context

Fintechs often struggle with **user drop-offs** after initial sign-up. This project answers:
- Where are users dropping off?
- Do support requests help?
- What is the potential financial gain if we fix specific friction points?

---

## 📊 Key Highlights

| Insight | Result |
|--------|--------|
| 🧯 Major Drop | 40%+ drop after KYC → Link |
| 🤖 Clustering | 3 user segments: Early Exit, Late Exit, Happy Path |
| 💬 Support Helped? | Slight improvement in time-to-convert |
| 💰 Revenue | Only 1 segment generated ₹218K |
| 📈 What-if Uplift | Recovering 20% of dropouts → +₹48K in revenue |
